These have been implemented using Python along with the Flask web
framework. Additionally, for data storage and retrieval, Redis has
been utilized, and for applying the Post HTTP method, Postman has been
used. Furthermore, a load balancer has been defined for the Kubernetes
cluster.

 While this setup is relatively straightforward, I have plans to
develop advanced clips that incorporate additional microservices and
leverage ReactJS for the Presentation layer. Additionally, I aim to
host this Web project on AWS Amplify.
